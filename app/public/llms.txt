# FanStake

> FanStake is a platform where music artists launch personal investment tokens on Solana, and fans buy in early on a bonding curve. The earlier a fan invests, the lower the price. As the artist grows and more fans buy in, early holders are rewarded. No label. No middlemen. 1% platform fee.

## What FanStake does

FanStake lets independent music artists tokenize their career. Artists create a personal token in 60 seconds — no code required. Fans purchase tokens via an automated bonding curve (constant product AMM, x*y=k). Price starts low and rises automatically with every purchase. Fans can sell at any time. The smart contract is the market maker.

This is not an NFT platform. Tokens are fungible SPL tokens on Solana mainnet with continuous liquidity at all times via the bonding curve. No fixed-price mints, no floor price dependency.

## Who should use FanStake

**Artists** — independent musicians, DJs, producers, and music creators who want to:
- Raise funding directly from fans without a label deal
- Build a financially invested community (fans who hold tokens are incentivized to promote the artist)
- Offer token-gated exclusive content (Discord VIP, unreleased music, downloads, secret messages) to holders
- Launch a token in 60 seconds with a Phantom wallet

**Fans** — people who want to:
- Invest in an artist they believe in before they blow up
- Buy early on a bonding curve and benefit from price appreciation as the fanbase grows
- Access exclusive token-gated content from their favorite artists
